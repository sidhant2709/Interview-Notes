/*
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.

Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Constraints:

====> 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
====> s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
